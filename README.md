# Epidemiology-Rice-Tungro-Disease
Deterministic model based on synergistic relationship between viruses - Stochastic model built by using Gillespies' Direct Method

Rice Tungro disease (RTD) is a good pathosystem to study due to its large contribution to yield loss in Southeast Asian and the underlying synergistic interaction of two viruses. Comparing the outcome from our ODE-based deterministic and stochastic model formed using Gillespie’s algorithm, the system’s stochasticity resistance to was shown. Parameter scans used to test the effect of poorly characterised parameters on the disease dynamics showed their unequal importance to RTD dynamics and negative synergism. Lastly, different roguing intervals were tested for their cost-effectiveness in various situations, and the result showed a promising low-varied control over RTD.
